# Restaurant Page

This is a browser website for a cafe. It has 3 different pages that users can access via tabs. The purpose of this project was to get familiar with webpack and tabbed browsing.

Built using Javascript and HTML/CSS.

## What I Learned

Learned how to install webpack and use it to do the following:
* Create bundles and modules and import/export them
* Load CSS and images
